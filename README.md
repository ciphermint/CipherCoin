[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/CipherCoin-Project/CipherCoin.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/CipherCoin-Project/CipherCoin) [![GitHub version](https://badge.fury.io/gh/CipherCoin-Project%2FCipherCoin.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/gh/CipherCoin-Project%2FCipherCoin)

CipherCoin is an open source crypto-currency focused on fast private transactions with low transaction fees & environmental footprint.  It utilizes a custom Proof of Stake protocol for securing its network and uses an innovative variable seesaw reward mechanism that dynamically balances 90% of its block reward size between masternodes and staking nodes and 10% dedicated for budget proposals. The goal of CipherCoin is to achieve a decentralized sustainable crypto currency with near instant full-time private transactions, fair governance and community intelligence.
- Anonymized transactions using the [_Zerocoin Protocol_](http://www.ciphercoin.org/zciph).
- Fast transactions featuring guaranteed zero confirmation transactions, we call it _SwiftX_.
- Decentralized blockchain voting utilizing Masternode technology to form a DAO. The blockchain will distribute monthly treasury funds based on successful proposals submitted by the community and voted on by the DAO.
